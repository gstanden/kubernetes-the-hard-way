# Provisioning Compute Resources

This take on Kubernetes the hard way is being done on a Lenovo P72 mobile workstation.  Cloud considerations from Kelsey's original work can be viewed at his original work here if you are looking for a cloud version of this: https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way
## Networking

The Kubernetes [networking model](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/networking/#kubernetes-model) assumes a flat network in which containers and nodes can communicate with each other. In cases where this is not desired [network policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) can limit how groups of containers are allowed to communicate with each other and external network endpoints.

> Setting up network policies is out of scope for this tutorial.

An Orabuntu-LXC subnet is used for this (10.209.0.0/24).

### Firewall Rules

Create a firewall rule that allows internal communication across all protocols:

```
firewalld-cmd rules are used here to allow tcp, udp, icmp.

```

Create a firewalld-cmd rule that allows external SSH, ICMP, and HTTPS:

```
  --allow tcp:22,tcp:6443,icmp \

```
No load balancer is used.

```
NAME                                    NETWORK                  DIRECTION  PRIORITY  ALLOW                 DENY  DISABLED
kubernetes-the-hard-way-allow-external  kubernetes-the-hard-way  INGRESS    1000      tcp:22,tcp:6443,icmp        False
kubernetes-the-hard-way-allow-internal  kubernetes-the-hard-way  INGRESS    1000      tcp,udp,icmp                Fals
```

### Kubernetes Public IP Address

For now this remains an open topic as to what I will use instead of a load balancer.  But note that Kelsey means here is that this address in the one-line table below will be a routable public address, not an internal (10.x.x.x or 192.x.x.x etc) address.

```
NAME                     ADDRESS/RANGE   TYPE      PURPOSE  NETWORK  REGION    SUBNET  STATUS
kubernetes-the-hard-way  xx.xxx.xxx.xxx  EXTERNAL                    us-west1          RESERVED
```

## Compute Instances

The compute instances in this lab will be provisioned using [Ubuntu Server](https://www.ubuntu.com/server) 20.04, which has good support for the [containerd container runtime](https://github.com/containerd/containerd). Each compute instance will be provisioned with a fixed private IP address to simplify the Kubernetes bootstrapping process.

### Kubernetes Controllers

Create three LXD containers which will host the Kubernetes control plane:

```
for i in {1..3} ; do eval echo "'lxc launch images:ubuntu/21.04 controller-${i} -p k8s' ; done
```

### Kubernetes Workers

Each worker instance requires a pod subnet allocation from the Kubernetes cluster CIDR range. The pod subnet allocation will be used to configure container networking in a later exercise. The `pod-cidr` instance metadata will be used to expose pod subnet allocations to compute instances at runtime.

> The Kubernetes cluster CIDR range is defined by the Controller Manager's `--cluster-cidr` flag. In this tutorial the cluster CIDR range will be set to `10.200.0.0/16`, which supports 254 subnets.

Create three compute instances which will host the Kubernetes worker nodes:

```
for i in 0 1 2; do
  gcloud compute instances create worker-${i} \
    --async \
    --boot-disk-size 200GB \
    --can-ip-forward \
    --image-family ubuntu-2004-lts \
    --image-project ubuntu-os-cloud \
    --machine-type e2-standard-2 \
    --metadata pod-cidr=10.200.${i}.0/24 \
    --private-network-ip 10.240.0.2${i} \
    --scopes compute-rw,storage-ro,service-management,service-control,logging-write,monitoring \
    --subnet kubernetes \
    --tags kubernetes-the-hard-way,worker
done
```

### Verification

List the compute instances in your default compute zone:

```
gcloud compute instances list --filter="tags.items=kubernetes-the-hard-way"
```

> output

```
NAME          ZONE        MACHINE_TYPE   PREEMPTIBLE  INTERNAL_IP  EXTERNAL_IP    STATUS
controller-0  us-west1-c  e2-standard-2               10.240.0.10  XX.XX.XX.XXX   RUNNING
controller-1  us-west1-c  e2-standard-2               10.240.0.11  XX.XXX.XXX.XX  RUNNING
controller-2  us-west1-c  e2-standard-2               10.240.0.12  XX.XXX.XX.XXX  RUNNING
worker-0      us-west1-c  e2-standard-2               10.240.0.20  XX.XX.XXX.XXX  RUNNING
worker-1      us-west1-c  e2-standard-2               10.240.0.21  XX.XX.XX.XXX   RUNNING
worker-2      us-west1-c  e2-standard-2               10.240.0.22  XX.XXX.XX.XX   RUNNING
```

## Configuring SSH Access

SSH will be used to configure the controller and worker instances. When connecting to compute instances for the first time SSH keys will be generated for you and stored in the project or instance metadata as described in the [connecting to instances](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/connecting-to-instance) documentation.

Test SSH access to the `controller-0` compute instances:

```
gcloud compute ssh controller-0
```

If this is your first time connecting to a compute instance SSH keys will be generated for you. Enter a passphrase at the prompt to continue:

```
WARNING: The public SSH key file for gcloud does not exist.
WARNING: The private SSH key file for gcloud does not exist.
WARNING: You do not have an SSH key for gcloud.
WARNING: SSH keygen will be executed to generate a key.
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
```

At this point the generated SSH keys will be uploaded and stored in your project:

```
Your identification has been saved in /home/$USER/.ssh/google_compute_engine.
Your public key has been saved in /home/$USER/.ssh/google_compute_engine.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:nz1i8jHmgQuGt+WscqP5SeIaSy5wyIJeL71MuV+QruE $USER@$HOSTNAME
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+

```

After the SSH keys have been updated you'll be logged into the `controller-0` instance:

```
Welcome to Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.4.0-1042-gcp x86_64)
...
```

Type `exit` at the prompt to exit the `controller-0` compute instance:

```
$USER@controller-0:~$ exit
```
> output

```
logout
Connection to XX.XX.XX.XXX closed
```
